# Hi there üëã

# About me

‚òÄÔ∏è I have always enjoyed problem-solving. Over the years I have used it in several different subjects, but I have always leaned towards problem-solving within technology. 

üë®‚Äçüéì At a relatively early age, I figured I wanted to be part of the software world, to continue doing what I like. I have therefore started studying Software Development, and I am now in my third semester. Until now, I have learned Java and Web programming well. Right now we are learning C#/Dotnet, SQL and Golang.

üôã As a person, I am helpful and enterprising and I am always ready for new challenges.
