# Hi there üëã

As a fourth-semester student of Software Development at the IT-University of Copenhagen, I have hands-on experience in web development, databases, and algorithms. I have gained a strong foundation in the following programming languages:

* Java
* C#
* Golang 

My coursework has honed my problem-solving skills and solidified my passion for technology. My helpful and enterprising nature, with solid communication skills, make me a valuable addition to any team. 

When not coding, I can be found at the local gym or in the student-run Caf√© called Analog. After volunteering as a barista and board member I may have become somewhat addicted to coffee, and it is therefore essential to my coding routine‚òïÔ∏è

I am currently learning:

* Mobile app development üì±
* Functional programming üî¨
* Scrum üìÖ 

Feel free to connect on LinkedIn, and let's see how our paths may cross in the future üîú
